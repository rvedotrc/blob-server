What is this?
=============

A simple RESTful server for storing and retrieving blobs.

It's based on Apache2 + mod_perl2.

Installation
============

For debian/ubuntu installation,

  sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-perl2

Then "./run"

You should add "./rotate-logs" to a crontab somewhere.

Upstart
=======

Currently the service is designed to run entirely as a non-root account, and
can be controlled using upstart.  To do this,

  vim init/blob-server.conf  # customise the path and username

  sudo apt-get install daemontools
  sudo install -m 644 init/blob-server.conf /etc/init/
  sudo start blob-server

instead of starting with "./run".
